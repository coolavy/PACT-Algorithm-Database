# Algorithm Database from *Algorithm Design by Kleinberg and Tardos*

This respository is a collection of all the algorithms and problems Professor Rajiv Gandhi teaches implemented in C++ and Python (Python support may vary). This is through his program PACT.

If you are interested in joining PACT, please join the upcoming information sessions for the 2026-2027 summer session. Information is available on the [website](https://algorithmicthinking.org/).

This respository is maintained and mainly meant for PACT students. But whether you are a PACT student or not, you may find this respository useful while you study *Algorithm Design by Kleinberg and Tardos*.

Below are some problems that correlate with certain algorithms in this respository, along with some notes. It is recommended that you try to solve each problem intuitively, and if possible, code your solution. 

**DFS & BFS**

Try to solve it first with one algorithm, and then with another.

[Building Roads](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1666)

[Building Teams](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1668)

**Topological Sort**

[Course Scheduling](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1679)

[Round Trip II](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1678) - Recommended, requires a bit more thought.

**Inversion Counting**

[INVCNT](https://www.spoj.com/problems/INVCNT/) - Can also be solved using BIT, policy-based structures, etc.

**Gale-Shapely**

[STABLEMP](https://www.spoj.com/problems/STABLEMP/)

**Binary Search**

[Counting Haybales](https://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=666) - Can be solved using C++'s lower_bound/upper_bound and bisect_left/bisect_right.
